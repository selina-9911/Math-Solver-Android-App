Part 1: Format Custom Image Data to Input to Keras Model:
I. We loop through the images which are currently named as ‘id.jpg’
II. strip the .jpg from them
III. Match them with the breed from the naming dictionary.
IV. We will then name them based on how many of this breed we have already counted
V. Finally, increment the count with this new instance.

def label_img(name):
  word_label = name.split('-')[0]
  if word_label == 'golden_retriever' : return np.array([1, 0])
  elif word_label == 'shetland_sheepdog' : return np.array([0, 1])

Part 3: Improving the Model:
I. Adding more Dropout Layers
II. Convolutional Network Parameters
III. Altering the Multi-Layer Feed-Forward NN at the end of the network
IV. Data Augmentation
V. Dog Object Detection Cropping
