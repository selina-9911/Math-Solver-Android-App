# Math Solver Android App

Team Members: Selina Lin, Frank Sun, George Liu

The goal of our groupâ€™s project is to create an app that would take a picture of a handwritten math equation or calculus problem and be able to solve it. An easily accessible and convenient app would benefit math education around the world as students would be able to get instant feedback on their work. For current day equation solvers, it can be tricky to type in various forms of equations, and systems such Latex are not intuitive for typing equations. Therefore, having an app which could snap a picture of handwritten work would improve student efficiency, so using handwriting and image recognition could be beneficial for a student workflow. Ideally, the application would be able to recognize handwritten or typed math problems from an image and would display a solution and potentially a step-by-step solution guide.
